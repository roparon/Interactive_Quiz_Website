How It Works

Track Progress: A progress bar updates as the user answers questions, providing a visual representation of their progress through the quiz.
Results: At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with their score and a completion message. They can then choose to restart the quiz.
Features in Detail

Final Score: After completing all questions, the user's final score is shown, along with a message of encouragement based on their performance.

Quiz Restart: Users can restart the quiz by clicking the "Restart Quiz" button, which resets their score and question index.
